# Lab Report 1
***
For this Lab Report, I will be using the “lecture1” repository to show off the examples for each command.

First command: cd
  1. An example of using “cd” without any arguments:
![Image](cd_ex1.png)	
*Working Directory: In this case, the working directory was the initial working directory which can be referred to as home.
*There was no output, and the use case of the command “cd” with no arguments is to take you to your home directory, and as I already was in the home directory, there   was no change due to this command being run on the terminal.
*There was no error in the output.
